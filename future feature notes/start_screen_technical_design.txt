START SCREEN TECHNICAL DESIGN PROPOSAL

Goal:
Implement a welcoming start screen for the Bookaroo game that aligns with the leftmost visual mockup and fulfills the UX and technical requirements from start_screen_prd.txt.

Design Overview:
- Display a full-screen start screen when the game loads
- Include a responsive, colorful background with a centered layout
- Feature the “Bookaroo” title in a large, playful font with an orange outline
- Include a prominent “Start” button underneath the title
- Present a cartoon-style child reading a book with surrounding elements (e.g., teddy bear, ball)
- Ensure all visual elements scale appropriately with the window size

Components:
1. HTML Structure:
   - <div class="start-screen">
     - <h1 class="title">Bookaroo</h1>
     - <img src="images/child_reading.png" alt="Child Reading" class="hero-image">
     - <button id="start-button">Start</button>
   - </div>

2. CSS Styling:
   - Full-screen flexbox layout to center content
   - Blue background with soft clouds or stars (CSS or image)
   - Responsive typography and image sizing (use vw/vh units)
   - Animated transitions for a playful feel (e.g., button hover, fade-in)
   - Ensure contrast and readability of the title and buttons

3. JavaScript Behavior:
   - Wait for DOM to load, then display the start screen
   - Clicking “Start” hides the start screen and initializes the game (calls showWord())
   - Future-proof with commented placeholder logic for session configuration

4. Assets:
   - “Bookaroo” logo or styled title (may be HTML/CSS or SVG)
   - Child reading image and background image (or gradient/background color fallback)
   - Optional confetti or sparkles on start button click

Scalability & Maintainability:
- CSS variables for theme customization
- Modular CSS class structure (e.g., .start-screen, .title, .hero-image)
- Separate image assets stored in /images
- Future session options can be added via another button or menu slideout

Next Steps:
- Confirm design direction
- Prepare final image assets
- Begin implementation (HTML, CSS, JS)
