\f0\fs24 \cf0 Session length PRD\
\
High-level objectives:   A key value of the game is having a large number of words so that the child user expands their vocabulary, recognizes patterns (phonics), and ultimately can read more words. However, children have short attention spans. We now have enough words that we cannot expect a user to go through every single word in a single session. Therefore, we should start providing options on session length and focus areas. We will start simple, constraining the session to 10 randomly selected words. Then we will expand from there to give users the option of selecting how long they want their session to be. Then we will expand from there by also starting to define different characteristics of words \'97 difficulty, word length, phonics, overall difficulty. }
